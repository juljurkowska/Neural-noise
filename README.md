### Bachelor's Thesis: "Verification of the neural noise hypothesis of dyslexia"

Bachelor's thesis carried out as part of a project aimed at verification a new theory “neural noise hypothesis of dyslexia” (Hancock et al., 2017). 
This theory suggests that dyslexia might be a consequence of neuronal hyperexcitability thatcontributes to learning deficits by heightened noise and instability in information processing.
